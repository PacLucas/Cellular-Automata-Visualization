# Cellular Automata Visualization in C

One-Dimensional Cellular Automata Visualization implemented in C

## Abstract

Cellular automata are able to represent complex systems simply and efficiently, using cells, predefined states and a set of rules, if it is possible to simulate biological evolution, model urban spaces and even generate music. This article tells a bit of its history, shows its definitions, workings, and makes a C implementation for better visualization and understanding.
